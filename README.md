# House price prediction Using Linear & Multiple Regression
I used Housing.csv dataset for task 3
So, I understand how to implement dataset in Linear (simple)regression and  multiple regression.
First of all I Preprocessed dataset  and split it into two parts one for training and another for testing.
Used Simple Linear Regression model to see how just area affects the price and I used Multiple Linear Regression model  to see how area, bedrooms, and bathrooms together affect the price.Created the two models .
Tested both models to see how well they predict the price using accuracy scores.
Plotted the prediction line for the simple model to visualize how price changes with area.
Checked the coefficients to understand which feature increases or decreases the price and by how much.
